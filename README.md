# StartingCodeBase

This project is intended to hold code that students can use -- any way they want --
during the class "Betriebssysteme" ("Operating Systems") at the fbi.h-da.de.

If you have been given a copy of this project, you copy is yours to do with
as you (and the other members of your team) see fit. Take it or leave it, 
modify it as you will -- you are responsible for everything you change *and* 
everything you choose to leave untouched.

Be prepared to answer the simply question "Why is it now (still) the way it is"?

Looking forward to seeing what you've done,

Ronald Moore <mailto:ronald.moore@h-da.de>

P.S: A good example of something you might want to consider changing is the text
immediately above this "P.S.". It's one thing for me to sign my copy of the
README; it's something else entirely for you to leave it there.
