# StartingCodeBase

This project is intended to hold code that students can use -- any way they want --
during the class "Betriebssysteme" ("Operating Systems") at the fbi.h-da.de.

This version of this project was prepared for Winter Semester 2019/20.

Additions will be made in the course of the semester.

If you have been given a copy of this project, your copy is yours to do with
as you (and the other members of your team) see fit. Take it or leave it, 
modify it as you will -- you are responsible for everything you change *and* 
everything you choose to leave unchanged.

Be prepared to answer the simply question "Why is it now (still) the way it is"?

Looking forward to seeing what you've done,

Ronald Moore <mailto:ronald.moore@h-da.de>

P.S: A good example of something you should change is the text
immediately above this "P.S.". It's one thing for me to sign my copy of the
README; it's something else entirely for you to leave my signature there.
